TODO:

- check that Target Account & Source accounts are different
- expose Swing names as constants in the View/Presenter class
- GncFile.addTransaction: validate source/target account are valid IDs (exist in file) 
- Resolve temporal coupling in loading the input files through enable/disable controls in the UI
  Options:
   - force a particular order: 1st Gnc, then Csv
   - allow any order, but disallow Import button until both are loaded
- GncFile.findAccountByName: what if names are not unique?
- What if the model can't find the default source/target accounts in the gnc file?
- select current account when displaying the target account pop-up (currently shows the last selected item)

   
==================
DONE:
- Presenter to set the default target account in TxData instead of the view
- Presenter to set the default source account ID
- Model.saveTxTo: the filename should be the output file name, instead of a hard-coded value 
   -> change after implementing the openopenGncFile function (!!)
- BUG: changing the Target Account doesn't change the Accounts attached to the TxData objects !!
