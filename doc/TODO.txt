TODO:

Features:
- I can import two files in a row
- App remembers location of files
- App automatically recognizes transactions by description and assigns them to a category
- Change the UI to a wizard (with steps) 

end-to-end test improvements:
- extract window driver from app driver
- add more e-to-e tests for all other high-level features

General improvements:
- check that Target Account & Source accounts are different
- Resolve temporal coupling in loading the input files through enable/disable controls in the UI
  Options:
   - force a particular order: 1st Gnc, then Csv
   - allow any order, but disallow Import button until both are loaded
   - handle the problem more gratiously (abort load and show proper error message)
- GncFile.addTransaction: validate source/target account are valid IDs (exist in file) 
- handle double-click(?) and ESC in the acc tree dialog   
- create build & test script  

==================
DONE:
- Presenter to set the default target account in TxData instead of the view
- Presenter to set the default source account ID
- Model.saveTxTo: the filename should be the output file name, instead of a hard-coded value 
   -> change after implementing the openopenGncFile function (!!)
- BUG: changing the Target Account doesn't change the Accounts attached to the TxData objects !!
- select current account when displaying the target account pop-up (currently shows the last selected item)
- can source and target be set in any order? => YES
- expose Swing names as constants in the View/Presenter class
- GncFile.findAccountByName: what if names are not unique? => no an issue. it will return the first.
- What if the model can't find the default source/target accounts in the gnc file?
- Update Tx Count after filtering
- gnc::Account class leaks outside the Model - use AccountData instead?
