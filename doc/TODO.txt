TODO:

DONE - Presenter to set the default target account in TxData instead of the view
- expose Swing names as constants in the View/Presenter class
- Presenter to set the default source account ID
- GncFile.addTransaction: validate source/target account are valid IDs (exist in file) 

- Resolve temporal coupling in loading the input files through enable/disable controls in the UI
  Options:
   - force a particular order: 1st Gnc, then Csv
   - allow any order, but disallow Import button until both are loaded
