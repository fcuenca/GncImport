USE CASE: Importing transactions from bank CSV into GnuCash XML database

* Detailed Scenario:

- I select the CSV file to be used as input
- I select the Gnc file to be used as output
- From the Gnc data file, I select:
   - The Account to be used as the origin of the funds
   - The Account hierarchy used for the expenses 
- I'm presented with a list of the transactions contained in the CSV file
- I can select which transactions will be imported/ignored:
  - by indicating first and last line number 
  - by marking individual lines
- I can associate each individual transaction with an expense account
- I can edit the description of some transactions
- Once I'm ready, I execute the import and the App saves the new transactions to the Gnc file 

* Sashimi Slices:

Kernel:
- The app reads a CSV file of a fixed name residing in the current directory
- The app opens a Gnc file of a fixed name residing in the current directory
- The app finds an Account named "Bank Account" as source of the funds
- The app will use the Account "Expenses" as expense hierarchy
- The app shows all the transactions in the CSV file
- On import, all transactions are imported

Expansions:
- Selection of the input file
- Selection of the output file
- Selection of the source account
- Selection of the target account hierarchy
- Ignoring transactions by line number
- Ignoring individual transactions
- Associating individual transactions with expense accounts in the hierarchy
- Editing transaction data
