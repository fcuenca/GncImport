Decided what Process to follow:

   - Select a feature: do Product Sashimi to slice it
   - Identify Kernel slice
      - Create a failing end-to-end-test
      - Test drive implementation by "micro-feature"
      - Make the e-to-e test pass
      - Integrate the UI. Exploratory test.
   - Continue with "expansion" slices, and repeat.

First feature is "Basic import"; the kernel slice is import to/from hard-coded file names, 
with all the selections set to default. 

Where to start?

   - "I like to start any application with a feature that tells the user something, then work my way back to the 
     feature that lets the user provide information." [JB]
   - First "micro-feature" is to display the (hard coded) number of transactions in the status line.
   - Second micro-feature: display a grid of transactions (still hard coded)
   - 3rd micro-feature: read data from real CSV file
   - 4th micro-feature: write to GNC file

Next Step: Lookup of account IDs from GNC file:
    - first step: hard-code IDs in presenter -> then push down to model
    - 2nd step: hard-code account names, look-up ids from GNC file
    - 3rd step: Move hard-coded account names to some sort of config object => decided to do this later

Next Step: implement the idea of "target account hierarchy", rather than an individual account.
    - 1st step: Restrict the list of accounts sent to the UI to those in the hierarchy 
       - hard coded for now to "Enero 2014"
       - lookup the default target account by name under the hierarchy
    - 2nd: show the target in the UI; then allow to change it
       - requires adding a second hierarchy in the test file
    - 3rd: decide how to select the hierarchy: ask? take from date? ?? 
    
    - AHA!! I need to be able to select accounts OUTSIDE the target hierarchy (income, special expenses, etc.)
       => and this has implications in the reset target hierarchy scenario when deciding to revert account to default!

Next Step: add date filtering for the transaction list (so that I don't have to edit the CSV file!)
